        <h3> THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK by Sir James M. Barrie</h3>
        <p>
            SIR HARRY. [_Complacently._] Did that seem all right, eh?
        </p>
        <p>
            LADY SIMS. [_Much relieved._] I think perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            SIR HARRY. But was it dignified?
        </p>
        <p>
            LADY SIMS. Oh, very. <br>And it will be still more so when you have the
sword.
        </p>
        <p>
            SIR HARRY. The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
moments--[_suiting the action to the word_]--the glide--the dip--the
kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. <br>
It's short, but it's a very
beautiful ceremony. [_Kindly._] Anything you can suggest?
        </p>
        <p>
            LADY SIMS. No--oh, no. [_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
of a cushion._] You don't think you have practised till you know what to
do almost too well? <br>
[_He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism
would try any man._
        </p>
        <p>
            SIR HARRY. I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
            asked for.   
        </p>
