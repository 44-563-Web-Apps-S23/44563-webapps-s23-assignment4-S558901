    his mighty task._]</p>
<p class="speech" >Exactly. You can show her in, Tombes.   </p>
<p class="speech" >You can tell the woman what she is wanted for, Emmy,
    while I change  </p>

    to keep a wife in the house for that purpose._]</p>

                scarcely worth mentioning, rather likes her._ LADY SIMS _has a maid for
                buttoning and unbuttoning her, and probably another for waiting on the
                maid, and she gazes with a little envy perhaps at a woman who does
                things for herself_.]</p>
